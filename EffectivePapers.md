Tacit Knowledge: Writing Effective Research Papers in Economics and Finance

The Fundamental Truth

The difference between a paper that gets published in a top journal and one that doesn’t often has little to do with the raw quality of the idea or the data. It has everything to do with how clearly the contribution is articulated, how well objections are anticipated, and how easy the paper is to evaluate.

Editors and referees are not trying to discover brilliance. They are trying to avoid mistakes. Your job is to make saying “yes” feel safe.

⸻

Part 0: The Non-Negotiables (Read Before Writing)

Every successful paper satisfies all five:
	1.	One Big Thing – The paper is about one core insight.
	2.	Claim Discipline – Claims never exceed what identification allows.
	3.	Credibility First – Identification is visible early and clearly.
	4.	Scope Control – Every result earns its place.
	5.	Reader Ease – The paper is fast to understand and hard to misunderstand.

If any one of these fails, the paper struggles—regardless of idea quality.

⸻

Part 1: The Architecture of a Convincing Paper

The “So What” Test

Within the first two paragraphs, the paper must clearly answer:
	1.	Why should a skeptical economist or finance scholar care?
	2.	What do we learn that we did not know before?
	3.	Why is this design the right way to learn it?

If the reader cannot answer these quickly, the editor will not send the paper out.

The Contribution Hierarchy (Reality-Based)

Not all contributions are equal. Journals reward:
	1.	New facts that change beliefs – “We thought X; the data show Y.”
	2.	Mechanisms that resolve puzzles – “Here is why X occurs.”
	3.	Designs or methods others will adopt – Rare, but powerful.
	4.	Sharper estimates of known relationships – Publishable with strong execution.
	5.	Replication or validation – Valuable, but usually insufficient alone.

A competitive paper contains at least one of the first three.

The One Big Thing Principle

Top papers are remembered for exactly one insight.

Your paper must be summarizable in one sentence without qualifiers or lists. If you need multiple sentences, you have multiple papers—or none yet.

⸻

Part 2: Introduction as an Argument (Not a Template)

Introductions are not literature summaries or method previews. They are arguments for why the paper deserves to exist.

Functional Blocks of a Strong Introduction

(Not fixed paragraphs—logical components.)
	1.	Hook and Motivation – A fact, puzzle, or tension readers already care about.
	2.	Research Question – Sharp, narrow, and explicit.
	3.	Main Result – Lead with the most important finding and its magnitude.
	4.	Credibility Preview – Why the identification is plausible.
	5.	Why It Matters – What changes if we believe this.
	6.	Positioning – Relation to 3–5 essential papers.
	7.	Roadmap – Brief, mechanical.

Common Introduction Failures
	•	Starting with the literature
	•	Explaining methods before motivation
	•	Listing too many results
	•	Sounding defensive before stating findings

If the editor cannot restate your contribution after page 2, the paper is finished.

⸻

Part 3: Claim Discipline (Critical)

Matching Claims to Identification

Identification Strength	Permissible Language
Randomized / Sharp RD	“Causal effect of X on Y”
Clean DiD / Policy Shock	“Evidence that X affects Y”
IV with assumptions	“Consistent with a causal interpretation”
Panel FE	“Associated with”
Cross-section	“Correlates with”

Rule: If the design is weak, weaken the claim—not the explanation.

Over-claiming is the fastest path to rejection.

⸻

Part 4: Identification and Credibility

Identification Families (Not Rankings)

Credibility depends on execution, not labels.
	•	Experimental designs
	•	Quasi-experimental designs (RD, DiD, policy changes)
	•	Instrumental variables
	•	Panel designs
	•	Descriptive designs

Each can be convincing—or fatal.

The Identification Paragraph

Every empirical paper needs a paragraph that answers:
	1.	What variation identifies the effect?
	2.	Why is it plausibly exogenous?
	3.	What is the thought experiment?
	4.	What could go wrong—and why doesn’t it?

If this paragraph is weak, nothing else matters.

⸻

Part 5: Scope Control

The Kill Rule

Every result must strengthen at least one of:
	•	Identification
	•	Mechanism
	•	External validity

Otherwise, cut it.

Extra results dilute attention and invite referee attacks.

⸻

Part 6: Tables, Figures, and Visual Logic

Figures First

Figures are arguments, not decoration.
	•	Stand alone
	•	Make one point
	•	Be visually clean

Figure 1 must visually communicate the main result.

Tables
	•	Column 1: Baseline
	•	Columns 2–N: Logical extensions
	•	Emphasize magnitudes, not stars

Confidence intervals > significance stars.

⸻

Part 7: Writing Style and Precision

Principles
	•	Active voice
	•	One idea per paragraph
	•	Numbers over adjectives
	•	Verbs consistent with identification

Mechanisms
	1.	State the mechanism
	2.	Derive a testable implication
	3.	Test it
	4.	Interpret narrowly

Mechanisms without tests are speculation.

⸻

Part 8: Literature Review as Positioning

Purpose

The literature review exists to answer:

What conversation is this paper entering, and what does it add?

The Three-Paper Rule
	1.	Canonical reference
	2.	Most recent influential paper
	3.	Closest paper to yours

Discuss these seriously. Others get brief mentions.

⸻

Part 9: Robustness

Robustness shows your result is not an artifact—not that it is true.

Essential checks:
	•	Alternative samples
	•	Alternative measures
	•	Placebos and falsification

Robustness cannot rescue a weak design.

⸻

Part 10: Editors, Referees, and the Meta-Game

How Editors Desk Reject

Editors ask:
	1.	Is the contribution obvious immediately?
	2.	Is identification clear without the appendix?
	3.	Does this fit the journal?
	4.	Does this look competently executed?

If any answer is no, the paper stops.

Referee Responses

Be precise, complete, and calm. Address everything. Make it easy to say yes.

⸻

Part 11: Submission Strategy
	•	Be realistic about journal tier
	•	Optimize for fit, not ego
	•	Desk rejections save time
	•	Circulate before submitting

⸻

Part 12: When to Stop

The paper is ready when:
	•	Core estimates are stable
	•	Seminar questions are predictable
	•	Claims are disciplined
	•	Marginal changes are cosmetic

Submit.

⸻

Appendix: Final Checklist
	•	One-sentence contribution
	•	Identification explained early
	•	Claims match design
	•	Figures tell the story
	•	Results earn their place
	•	Writing is clean and precise

⸻

Clear writing is disciplined thinking made visible.
