# Tacit Knowledge: Writing Effective Research Papers in Economics and Finance

## The Fundamental Truth

The difference between a paper that gets published in a top journal and one that doesn't often has little to do with the quality of the idea or the data. It's about **how you tell the story**, **how you anticipate objections**, and **how you make the reader's job easy**.


Every extra result weakens the main result unless it directly sharpens it.

--- 
## Part 0: The Non‑Negotiables (Read Before Writing)

### Every successful paper satisfies all five:

1. One Big Thing – The paper is about one core insight.

2. Claim Discipline – Claims never exceed what identification allows.

3. Credibility First – Identification is visible early and clearly.

4. Scope Control – Every result earns its place.

5. Reader Ease – The paper is fast to understand and hard to misunderstand.

If any one of these fails, the paper struggles—regardless of idea quality.

## Part 1: The Architecture of a Convincing Paper

### The "So What" Test

Every paper must pass the "so what" test within the first two paragraphs. Readers—especially referees—are busy and skeptical. They're asking:

1. **Why should I care about this question?**
2. **What's new here that we didn't already know?**
3. **Why is this paper the right way to answer this question?**


### The Contribution Hierarchy

Not all contributions are equal. In descending order of impact:

1. **New facts that change how we think** - "We thought X, but actually Y"
2. **New mechanisms that explain puzzles** - "Here's why X happens"
3. **New methods that others will use** - Rare, but valuable
4. **Better estimates of known relationships** - Necessary but not sufficient
5. **Replication with different data** - Important but hard to publish alone

Your paper needs at least one contribution from the top three tiers.

### The "One Big Thing" Principle

Top papers are remembered for one thing. Not three things. Not five things. One thing.

Your paper should have **one sentence** that captures what you found. If you can't write that sentence, you're not ready to submit.

---

## Part 2: The Introduction Formula

The introduction is 80% of whether your paper gets accepted. Here's the structure that works: 

(Not fixed paragraphs but logical components.)

### Paragraph 1: The Hook
- Start with a fact, puzzle, or question that grabs attention
- Connect to something readers already care about
- Avoid: "This paper studies..." as your first sentence

### Paragraph 2-3: What We Do
- State your research question precisely
- Describe your approach in one sentence
- Preview your main finding

### Paragraph 4-5: What We Find
- Lead with your most important result
- Give a number: "We find that X increases Y by Z%"
- Immediately address the magnitude: Is this economically significant?

### Paragraph 6-7: Why It's Credible
- Anticipate the main objection
- Explain why your identification works
- Don't oversell—acknowledge limitations briefly

### Paragraph 8-9: Why It Matters
- Connect to policy or theory
- Explain what changes if we believe your findings
- Be specific, not vague

### Final Paragraphs: Literature and Roadmap
- Position relative to 3-5 key papers (not 50)
- Brief roadmap of paper structure

### Common Introduction Mistakes

1. **The literature review introduction** - Nobody wants to read two pages of "Smith (2010) found... Jones (2015) showed..."
2. **The methodology introduction** - Don't explain your IV strategy before readers know why they should care
3. **The everything introduction** - Trying to preview every result buries the main point
4. **The defensive introduction** - Don't spend paragraphs on limitations before stating findings

---

## Part 3: Identification and Credibility

### The Identification Paragraph 

If the design is weak, weaken the claim and not the explanation.

Over‑claiming is the fastest path to rejection.

Every empirical paper needs an "identification paragraph" that answers:

1. What variation are you using?
2. Why is that variation plausibly exogenous?
3. What's the thought experiment?
4. What could go wrong, and why doesn't it?

### The "Skeptical Referee" Test

Before submitting, imagine a skeptical referee asking:

- "But couldn't this just be reverse causality?"
- "What about omitted variable X?"
- "How do you know the treatment is exogenous?"
- "Isn't this just picking up Y instead?"

If you can't answer these, run more robustness checks or acknowledge the limitation.

### Scope Control
The Kill Rule: Every result must strengthen at least one of:
1. Identification
2. Mechanism
3. External validity

Otherwise, cut it. Extra results dilute attention and invite referee attacks.

## Part 4: Tables and Figures

### Figures First, Tables Second

Readers look at figures before reading text. Your figures should:

1. **Stand alone** - Interpretable without reading the paper
2. **Tell a story** - Each figure should make one point
3. **Be visually clean** - No chartjunk, clear labels, readable fonts

### The "Figure 1" Rule

Your first figure should convey your main result visually. Common effective formats:

- **Binscatter**: Shows relationship between X and Y with controls absorbed
- **Event study**: Shows dynamic effects around treatment
- **Distribution comparison**: Shows treated vs control groups
- **Coefficient plot**: Shows effects across subgroups or specifications

### Table Best Practices

**Structure:**
- Column 1: Baseline specification
- Columns 2-N: Progressive addition of controls/fixed effects
- Show how coefficient changes (or doesn't) as you add controls

**Formatting:**
- Three significant digits maximum
- Stars for significance, but always report standard errors
- N and R² in every column
- Clear, descriptive column headers

**What to Report:**
- The coefficient you care about prominently
- Key controls (but don't report everything)
- Fixed effects included (just note, don't show coefficients)

### The Coefficient Plot

For papers with heterogeneity or robustness:
- Show all specifications on one plot
- Include confidence intervals
- Order meaningfully (not alphabetically)
- Add a vertical line at zero

---

## Part 5: Writing Style

1. **Use active voice**: "We find" not "It was found"
2. **Be specific**: "Prices increase 15%" not "Prices increase substantially"
3. **Cut unnecessary words**: "In order to" → "To"
4. **One idea per paragraph**: Don't cram

### Hedging Done Right

**Too weak:**
> "Our results tentatively suggest that there might possibly be some association..."

**Too strong:**
> "We prove that X causes Y"

**Just right:**
> "We find a robust positive relationship between X and Y, consistent with [mechanism]. While we cannot rule out all alternative explanations, our results survive [robustness checks]."

### The "Mechanism" Discussion

Top journals want to know WHY, not just WHAT. Structure mechanism discussions as:

1. State the potential mechanism
2. Derive a testable implication
3. Test it
4. Discuss whether it supports or refutes the mechanism

### Phrases to Avoid

| Instead of... | Write... |
|---------------|----------|
| "Very unique" | "Unique" |
| "Proves that" | "Provides evidence that" |
| "Obviously" | [Delete—if it's obvious, don't say it] |
| "Interestingly" | [Delete—let readers decide] |
| "It is important to note" | [Just state the thing] |
| "Significant" (for important) | "Substantial" or "Large" |
| "This paper contributes to the literature" | [Show, don't tell] |

## Part 6: The Literature Review

### The Purpose of Literature Review

The literature review is NOT:
- A comprehensive survey of everything written on the topic
- An opportunity to cite everyone who might referee your paper
- A defensive listing of prior work

The literature review IS:
- Positioning your contribution relative to what exists
- Showing you understand the conversation you're joining
- Identifying the gap you're filling

### The Three-Paper Rule

For any topic, identify:
1. **The canonical paper** everyone cites
2. **The most recent important paper** that moved the field
3. **The paper most similar to yours** that you're improving upon

Discuss these three in depth. Others get brief mentions.

### Positioning Strategies

**The "Yes, But" Position:**
> "Prior work established X. However, this literature has not addressed Y, which is important because Z."

**The "New Data" Position:**
> "Theory predicts X, but data limitations have prevented testing. We use [new data] to provide the first test."

**The "Reconciliation" Position:**
> "Paper A finds X, Paper B finds -X. We show that both are correct because [mechanism]."

**The "Generalization" Position:**
> "Prior work focused on [narrow setting]. We show this extends to [broader setting]."

## Part 7: Robustness and Sensitivity

### What Robustness Checks Actually Show

Robustness checks demonstrate that your result is not:
- An artifact of one specification choice
- Driven by outliers
- Sensitive to sample definition
- Dependent on functional form assumptions

### The Essential Robustness Checks

1. **Alternative samples**: Drop outliers, different time periods, subsamples
2. **Alternative measures**: Different definitions of key variables
3. **Alternative specifications**: Add/remove controls, different fixed effects
4. **Placebo tests**: Fake treatments should show no effect
5. **Falsification tests**: Effects shouldn't appear where theory says they shouldn't

### Presenting Robustness

**In the main text:**
- Discuss 2-3 most important robustness checks
- Explain why these particular checks matter

**In appendix:**
- Comprehensive table showing all specifications
- Coefficient should be stable across specifications

### When Robustness Fails

If your result is sensitive to specification:
1. **Understand why** - Is there a substantive reason?
2. **Be honest** - Report the sensitivity
3. **Restrict claims** - "Our result holds under X conditions"
4. **Investigate heterogeneity** - Maybe the effect varies legitimately

---

## Part 8: Responding to Referees

### The Meta-Game

Referee reports are not primarily about whether your paper is good. They're about:
1. Whether the referee found any problems
2. Whether those problems are fixable
3. Whether you seem competent enough to fix them

### The Response Letter Formula

For each comment:

1. **Thank the referee** (briefly, not sycophantically)
2. **Summarize their concern** (shows you understood)
3. **Explain what you did** (be specific)
4. **Point to where** (page/table/figure numbers)

### Dealing with Negative Comments

**If they're right:**
> "The referee correctly points out that [issue]. We have addressed this by [solution]. The results, shown in Table X, demonstrate that [conclusion]."

**If they're wrong:**
> "We appreciate this concern. However, we respectfully note that [explanation]. Nevertheless, to address any remaining concerns, we have [additional analysis]."

**If it's a matter of taste:**
> "Following the referee's suggestion, we have [made change]. We agree this improves the paper by [benefit]."

### The "Major Revision" Response

When you get a revise and resubmit:
- Address EVERY point (even minor ones)
- Do MORE than asked (shows good faith)
- Don't argue excessively (pick your battles)
- Make the referee's job easy (clear organization)

---

## Part 9: The Submission Strategy

### Journal Selection

**Factors to consider:**
1. **Prestige** - But be realistic about your paper's level
2. **Fit** - Does this journal publish this type of paper?
3. **Turnaround** - Some journals are notoriously slow
4. **Editor interests** - Who handles papers in your area?

### The Quality Ladder

Don't start at the top and work down. Assess honestly:

- **Top 5 (AER, QJE, JPE, Econometrica, REStud)**: Papers that change how we think about something
- **Top Field (JF, RFS, JFE for finance; JEEA, AEJ:Applied, etc.)**: Solid contributions with good identification
- **Good Field (JFQA, Management Science, etc.)**: Sound papers, maybe narrower contribution
- **Specialized**: Niche topics, specific methodologies

### Timing Considerations

- **Conferences first**: Present at NBER, AEA, AFA before submitting
- **Working paper circulation**: Get feedback before journal submission
- **Desk rejection**: Better than wasting 6 months in review
- **Coauthor timing**: All authors should review before submission

---

## Part 10: Unwritten Rules

### What Referees Actually Care About

1. **Is this interesting?** (First 5 minutes of reading)
2. **Is this credible?** (Next 30 minutes)
3. **Is this well-executed?** (Rest of the reading)
4. **Will this embarrass me if I recommend acceptance?**

### The "Tenure Standard"

Would you be comfortable if this paper were the main paper on someone's tenure file? If not, what's missing?

### The Conference Test

When you present at a seminar, watch for:
- **Where do people interrupt** - Those are the weak points
- **What questions keep coming up** - Address in the paper
- **When do people check their phones** - Those sections are boring

### The Coauthor Dynamic

- **Division of labor**: Clear responsibilities prevent conflict
- **Writing style**: One person should do final edit for consistency
- **Disagreements**: Resolve before submission, not after referee reports

### The "Desk Reject" Signals

Papers get desk rejected for:
1. **Obvious methodological flaws** (no identification strategy)
2. **Incremental contribution** (too similar to existing work)
3. **Wrong journal** (topic doesn't fit)
4. **Poor writing** (signals sloppiness throughout)
5. **Missing obvious robustness** (suggests inexperience)

---

## Part 11: The Psychological Game

### Dealing with Rejection

- **Every successful paper was rejected somewhere** (often multiple times)
- **Referees are often wrong** (but sometimes they're right)
- **Rejection is information** (what do you need to improve?)
- **Don't take it personally** (easier said than done)

### Writer's Block

- **Write badly first**: You can't edit a blank page
- **Write sections out of order**: Start where you have momentum
- **Set word count goals**: 500 words/day adds up
- **Separate writing and editing**: Different cognitive modes

### The Impostor Syndrome

Every academic feels like a fraud sometimes. The solution:
- Focus on the work, not on yourself
- Remember that everyone struggles
- Seek feedback early and often
- Celebrate small wins

### The Long Game

- **Papers take years**: First idea to publication is often 5+ years
- **Quality over quantity**: One great paper beats five mediocre ones
- **Build a portfolio**: Develop a coherent research agenda
- **Invest in relationships**: Coauthors, mentors, and colleagues matter

*"Good writing is clear thinking made visible."* — A reminder that the struggle to write clearly is really a struggle to think clearly about what you've found and why it matters.
